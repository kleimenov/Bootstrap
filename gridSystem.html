                    The history of the Buffalo Bills began in 1960, when the team began play 
                    as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL), winning two consecutive AFL titles
                    in 1964 and 1965. The club joined the National Football League (NFL) as part of the 1970 AFL-NFL 
                    merger. The Bills have the distinction of being the only team to advance to four consecutive 
                    Super Bowls between 1990 and 1993, but also the dubious distinction of losing all four of them.
