            The history of the Buffalo Bills began in 1960, when the team began play 
            as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL), winning two consecutive AFL titles
            in 1964 and 1965. The club joined the National Football League (NFL) as part of the 1970 AFL-NFL merger.
            The Bills have the distinction of being the only team to advance to four consecutive Super Bowls 
            between 1990 and 1993, but also the dubious distinction of losing all four of them. The second NFL team 
            to represent Buffalo, New York, the Bills were founded by Ralph Wilson, who owned the team 
            from its establishment until his death in 2014. The team was then sold to Terrence Pegula and his wife 
            Kim later that year.
